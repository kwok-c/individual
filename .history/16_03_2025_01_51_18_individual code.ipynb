Name, gender and age are the values selected by the player. Start and end time is the date and time when the player started and ended their session. Original start time and end time is the Unix time of the beginning and end of the play session.\n",

    "One method to answer this question is to use a simple k-nearest neighbor classification model to predict the experience level of the player. This method was chosen because we have a small data set of only 196 players and knn will allow us to classify them appropriately based on age and time played. For this method we assume to predict the class as the most frequent class of the nearest k values. This can be limiting if there is a large number of a certain experience level. For example, if a small number of players have the experience level of Regular it will likely never get predicted. Additionally, choosing the best k value will need to be done to get the best model. To do this, we can create a training model and use cross validation to determine the best k value to use. To train the model we will split the data into 75% training, 25% testing data and perform a 5 fold cross validation on the training data to train the model. The data collected from the training data will determine the best k value which will be tested using the training data to determine the strength of our model.\n"
